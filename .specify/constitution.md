# LearnFlow Project Constitution

## Core Objective

Build a cloud-native, AI-powered learning platform (LearnFlow) using a Skills-first approach, where AI agents build the system using reusable Skills optimized for token efficiency.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **Agentic Development**: All code and infrastructure must be generated by AI agents (Claude Code/Goose) using the Skills Library. Manual coding is forbidden.
2. **Architecture**:
   - **Service Mesh**: Dapr is mandatory for state, pub/sub, and invocation.
   - **Messaging**: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes is mandatory for event-driven flows.
   - **Containerization**: Everything must run on Kubernetes (Minikube local-first).
3. **Skill Standards (MCP Pattern)**:
   - All Skills must use the "Gold Standard" MCP pattern: minimal `SKILL.md` (<100 tokens), executable scripts in `scripts/`, and deep documentation in `REFERENCE.md`.
4. **Tech Stack**:
   - **Frontend**: Next.js with Monaco Editor for Python code execution.
   - **Backend**: FastAPI with OpenAI/OpenAI-compatible Agent SDK.
   - **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL.
   - **Documentation**: Docusaurus-based site.
5. **Multi-Agent System**: The platform must feature specialized tutor agents (Triage, Concepts, Code Review, Debug, Exercise, Progress).
6. **Token Efficiency**: 80-98% reduction in token usage for MCP interactions is required for scoring.

## Definition of Done

A fully functional Python tutoring platform deployed on Kubernetes, built autonomously by AI agents, and documented via a Docusaurus site.
